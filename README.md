# Electronics Retail Dbase Project
## Database creation & queries
### Introduction
This report examines an open-source dataset from a hypothetical worldwide electronics retailer, which consists of five tables: Customers, Sales, Products, Stores, and Currency Rates. The data includes store performance, product details, transactions, consumer demographics, and currency changes. Business development, customer behaviour, and sales dynamics are all major problem considerations. Total revenue and purchase frequency analysis demonstrate consumer loyalty and high-value tendencies. Store performance and average order value measure operational efficiency, while product analysis helps with inventory planning. Time-based trends and annual growth offer insights into seasonal patterns and corporate expansion.
